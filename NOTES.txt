Add my parameter 'RE Temps: a, b, c'
to ConfigSetup

I am working to get automated directory and conf file production.  The call to GOMC will still include only 1 .conf
But I have to add a +RE flag, because whether or not this is a replica exchange needs to be known so the number of Simulation objects can equal the number of replicas.  By the time the ConfigSetup object notices there are more than one temp in the conf file, it is too late to build more simulation objects.  Perhaps the first simulation object could be a factory that will build more as needed, but a flag is an easier method that requires less digging into the guts of GOMC.



Ok so as of now I need to get the up2date energy array into t4re.  prepare2doex returns fine,
since nothing is dependent on a functioning t state, its fine that it exists in name only as of right now but to carry out exchanges in need to fill her up.

TODO:

Scale vels - uneccessary 
exchan state
state object - points to the exchangeables in system
prng  - done, points to system's prng
file name fplog -- I think this is done
Dont atempt till after equilibration


Look into whether bonded energy should be considered in system total
Also investigate the meaning of replExParams->nex - I thought it would mean each replica only attempts one exchange
Check to make sure it doesnt mean of all replicas, only one exchange is attempted.

Also, fix the statistics, such as empirical transition matrix.  It doesnt show up at the end. 

Add a flag to check if OPENMP is def to Main

If NDEF 
OPENMP Throw error

GRID:

Install INTEL compiler / or GCC OPENMP
Not all clusters have OpenMP library

Intel 2016 - MPI

Load Module(Intel XXXX ; MPI ) 
Job Script on Website to run simulation

TODO:

Run through a couple exchanges to make sure the replicas recognize their new states (i.e. continue with a new coords, energies, in NPT , new vol. ect)
